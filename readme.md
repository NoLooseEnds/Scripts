# INFO

Forked from NoLooseEnds/Scripts, which contained R710-IPMI-TEMP - a
script to override the default fans behaviour in a Dell R710 idrac,
which defaults to powering up the fans to near full volume when third
party cards or non-Dell disks are added in.  I have extended it to
work on my R520, being a bit smarter regarding the CPU and HDD temps
instead of just caring about the ambient temperature.

Other scripts may end up here too some day.
